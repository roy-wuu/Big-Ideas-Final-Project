    "A getaway driver has to drive somewhere, and the best places for criminals to hide their new illicit gains are vacancies. Therefore, it stands to reason that the best areas to be a getaway driver are areas with many different vacancies to choose from. To find the best neighborhood to commit getaway crimes in Pittsburgh, the data set that I analyzed is the WORD Pennsylvania Vacant Addresses set. This set is created from the postal services record of failed deliveries, and uses this record over time to determine which addresses are vacant. The postal service has been gathering this data since its creation, but this vacancy set was created in 2016 and only observed back to 2012, and is updated to be current multiple times a year. It includes many fields, but the only ones applicable to my purposes are the geoid and the total vacancy count."
